# SMP

This project implements the code from the plugin [GSit](https://github.com/Gecolay/GSit) which is not my property nor my content, I had to implement it to do cool features with scoreboard outlines to players and fix issues where it would glitch out those outlines when un-mounting from locations.

Everything else is my code and is under the MIT license.

## Needs
This was made for 1.19 R.1 on a remap build from BuildTools.

## Commands

- `/prefix` - Sets your prefix
- `/taunt` - Taunt the player you are looking at
- `/gm` - Swaps gamemodes between survival, creative and spectator (if you have the permission)
- `/uhc` - Send a UHC message with a ping
- `/setlevel` - Sets yours or other players level (amount of deaths) (if you have the permission)
- `/teleport` - I dont need to explain this one
- `/achievements` - Shows an achievements log GUI of all the achievements you have unlocked, when you unlocked it and other stuff [not sure if I completed this so it might not work]
- `/vanish` - Toggles vanish
- `/teams` - Set your scoreboard team so it changes your outline and tab color
- `/bosstest_phase1` - This was experimental to test the boss phase 1, it is not finished and I suggest not using it as it will probably break some point in the world

- `/sit`- Sit on the floor
- `/lay` - Lay on the floor
